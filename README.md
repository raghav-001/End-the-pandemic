# End-the-pandemic
Here's interactive game designed using python to develop awareness about the pandemic. 
What the game is about?
The entire world is in ruins! The virus is around everywhere! You can do nothing but sanitize, maintain social distancing and save yourselves! You have a sanitizer in your hand, and you can kill the virus by using it, but never get too close to the virus or you will get infected! Also, make sure that the virus doesn't make it to your home. Kill the virus using your sanitizer before it gets there. Also, never go far way from your home as that puts you in danger as well!
Enjoy the game, follow the protocols, get the message that the game delivers!
